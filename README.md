# UFOs

### Overview of Project
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters for the city, state, country, and shape were added as well to create a more user friendly environment. 

### Results

#### Search Criteria Procedure
##### Index Page
This is the initial page. The user can re-initialize the page by clicking on the navbar at the top.

### Summary
- One drawback of this design is the difficulty for the user to know what parameter to use for the filtering. For example to pick a city, the user would have to go through the table a find the city desired for the analysis.
- A dropdown list of available cities would help users navigate the site better and assist with calibrating the search. 
- Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter. Including a button to clear the filters is also needed. The button would be located below the last filter.
